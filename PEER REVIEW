What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 Reviewing this project showed me that it is important to consider the size of my sprites.  Also, it is important to choose
 a background/background color that matches the theme of the game.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

    I liked that instead of a space shooter it was more of a hunting game, I like the creativity!

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

    If anything, I would adjust the size of the arrow and the forest ranger so that they look more balanced.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

    The name of the game could have been something more creative.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

    No, the code was pretty standard and easy to understand.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

    Yes, the respository contains an MIT license.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

    A description of the game would be a nice addition.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

    Everything was very organized and explained well, nice job.
